# Audio Game

This game makes use of audio tag and keyboard input to create a music notes dropping game.

This is originally from the book [HTML5 Games Development by Examples][1].

Please note that this code was written in 2012 and I didn't followed some best practice in Javasscript programming. It is suggested to learn the concept and update the code to follow latest JavaScript practice.
